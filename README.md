# Usgs Earthquake Mapping

This project contains two webpages which show earthquake activity during the past day using geological data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) via api calls and mapping data from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

The first webpage is a basic map of earthquake activity from the past day.

The second webpage is an interactive map of earthquake activity from the past day. It allows users to view earthquake activity using three different kinds of maps: Satellite, Greyscale, and Outdoors, as well as a map of world tectonic plates.
